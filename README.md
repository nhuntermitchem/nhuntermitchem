## Hey, I’m Hunter 👋

I’m a recruiter focused on early-stage, VC-backed startups in SF and NYC. 
I work closely with founders and senior engineers on difficult, high-impact hires.

### What I care about

- Long-term fits over quick placements

### What you’ll get if we talk
- Honest feedback
- No spam or spray-and-pray outreach
- Zero pressure if it’s not a fit

### Currently learning more about
- The newest tech impacting the AI wave and how companies are implementing them
- How teams scale from Seed to Series B
- What actually causes strong engineers to leave good jobs
